## Total Supply of XYZ Token
XYZ token is mintable and burnable ERC20 token. It can be minted only by treasury contract, but can be burned by the owner. 
The supply set by formula: 
```
supply = usdt / price
``` 
which *usdt* is liquidity in treasury and *price* is price in cult swap.
By the same formula: *price = usdt / supply* this mean price will increase if *usdt* increase or *supply* decrease.

## Distribution of XYZ Token

Every 24 hours 30% / 365 = 0.082% XYZ will be minted based on existing supply. 1/3 transfered to cult free claim, 2/3 transfered to cult vault. 
Distribution percentage may change later, after vote by nft implemented.

## Price of XYZ Token
Price of XYZ token soft pegged to assets value within treasury. In theory if treasury value always increase, the price always increase.

Treasury value ⬆️ on:
- cult $CFX staking interest used to buy $XYZ
